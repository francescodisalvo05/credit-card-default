# Default of credit card
Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments. For example, the U.S. federal government allows student debt to be delinquent for 270 days before declaring it to be in default. It is a delicate status because it will affect the relationship among the client and the card issuer but more important, it will decrease the probability to get approved for future credit-based services. The goal of this analysis is to predict if a client will go in default in the following month by using the Default of [Credit Card Clients Data Set as a reference](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)
